<body><h1 id="phase-3-from-vision-to-vocation">Phase 3:From Vision to Vocation</h1>
<p>“Before becoming a good doctor, one must first become a successful person.” This motto has guided my career vision from the start. I aspire not only to be a technically proficient surgeon but also a compassionate physician with social awareness, empathy, and responsibility. I want my surgical practice to be not only a matter of technique but also a bridge that connects people, ideas, and communities.</p>
<h3 id="a-surgeon-s-art-precision-and-empathy-combined">A Surgeon’s Art: Precision and Empathy Combined</h3>
<p>I intend to pursue training after PGY with a surgical residency program at National Cheng Kung University Hospital and assume the role of attending surgeon. Surgery is interesting due to the unique combination of technical skills and human compassion that coincide during an operation on the table. I see myself within next-gen surgery, tightly integrated into AI.</p>
<p>During my residency, I thus hope to gain knowledge of surgical applications of AI. I hope to become a “surgical physician-scientist,” integrating AI into optimizing surgical planning for each patient. For instance, patient-specific virtual anatomical modeling will enable the surgeon to practice the procedure, assess risks, and predict outcomes before actually entering the operating room—a critical step toward personalized precision medicine.</p>
<h3 id="innovative-research-and-international-exchange">Innovative Research and International Exchange</h3>
<p>As a future attending surgeon, I will dive into my passion for research into its next frontiers. One of the significant limitations robotic surgery faces today is the absence of haptic feedback; however, surgeons often depend on fingertip sensations for information regarding the tension and texture of tissues. I expect to be involved in research that develops new technologies. For example, simulated tactile feedback through robotic surgical arms to afford surgeons &quot;the sense of touch&quot; while operating remotely on the tissues. I believe this would be revolutionary in the field of surgery.</p>
<p>Under the inspiration of pioneers, Dr. Eric Topol, who brings AI into medicine, is indeed one source of inspiration and motivation for me. In order to continue this further, I would hope to be actively involved in further studies at programs such as the Journal of the American College of Surgeons and Annals of Surgery and to attend international meetings and research on this topic.</p>
<p>Apart from this, I have some special plans for international exposure. Given my family background, I have a strong emotional attachment to Vietnam. After my board certification in surgery, I will proceed with an international fellowship at Franco-Vietnamese Hospital (FV Hospital) in Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
<p>Being the first privately held hospital in Vietnam to gain JCI accreditation, FV Hospital has an integrated system that includes the first CyberKnife S7 technology for radiosurgery. Indeed, it has state-of-the-art healthcare in a different but challenging socioeconomic context. I would consider it a great experience learning from such models inspired by Europe and bringing such cross-national insights into Taiwan for our medical system&#39;s better global competitiveness.</p>
<h3 id="to-serve-and-encourage-bearing-the-responsibility-of-the-white-coat">To Serve and Encourage: Bearing the Responsibility of the White Coat</h3>
<p>A physician&#39;s role extends far beyond the practice of medicine into the realms of teaching and service to society. I aspire to take part in medical education and pass along clinical experiences and my passion for technology to the next generation, much like my mentors did for me. Furthermore, I plan to participate in international medical outreach programs and use the skills I develop at National Cheng Kung University to serve the less fortunate, which is the noblest ideal of serving humanity.</p>
<p>From the curiosity of childhood to a well-charted plan today, my passion for medicine only grows stronger. I am deeply committed to joining National Cheng Kung University&#39;s medical community, where I know I will receive world-class training, visionary exposure, and a solid humanistic foundation.</p>
