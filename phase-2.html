<h1 id="phase-2-refinement-and-deepening-six-years-of-medical-formation-at-national-cheng-kung-university">Phase 2:Refinement and Deepening—Six Years of Medical Formation at National Cheng Kung University</h1>
<p>If given the honor of entering the School of Medicine, National Cheng Kung University, I have a very concrete and realistic six-year study plan that I would pursue with full commitment to developing excellent medical training in terms of solid academic knowledge, clinical skills, and humanistic aspects.</p>
<h3 id="years-1-2-interdisciplinary-integration-and-a-broad-academic-foundation">Years 1–2: Interdisciplinary Integration and a Broad Academic Foundation</h3>
<p>What stands out impressively is that National Cheng Kung University has moved away from rote memorization and now embraces the principles of group-based and inquiry-based learning. I believe that my first two years will serve as the grounding years, where I intend to be open to the rich opportunities for interdisciplinary learning. In this regard, I will focus on mastering the fundamentals of General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, General Biology, and Biochemistry. Furthermore, I want to use digital tools to develop a personalized knowledge management system in Notion and will contribute in this regard to the departmental project of collaborative note-taking as a way to reinforce learning through collaboration.</p>
<p>In the humanities, I will take such courses as sociology, where I will learn to develop critical thinking when asking how social class shapes the policies and outcomes of health insurance. I wish to expand my horizons with general education courses. In Year 2, I will participate in more group discussions, interact with students from diverse backgrounds, and make use of time management to shape lifelong practices in self-directed learning—one of the labels a day for any physician. I plan to have a 4.0 GPA at this stage.</p>
<p>Outside the classroom, I want to hold medical camps and share my experiences with junior students. I would also join the Medical Service Club at National Cheng Kung University to continue my services to other people. The other club I would join at National Cheng Kung University is the Image Association, which hones communication and public speaking skills. A physician should be a healer, an educator, and a communicator, in essence. One of the milestones I want to achieve in my life is hosting the White Coat Ceremony for medical students.</p>
<p>Let me briefly outline my plans in this section. I will try to pursue some leadership positions in clubs to improve my organizing skills and read English medical journals so that I can use specific language in my profession and international communication.</p>
<h3 id="years-3-4-deepening-core-knowledge-and-developing-clinial-thinking">Years 3–4: Deepening Core Knowledge and Developing Clinical Thinking</h3>
<p>With the start of core courses in Year 3, such as Anatomy and Histology, I anticipate a significant leap in both the depth and breadth of learning. I especially look forward to cadaver dissection as a way to transform theoretical knowledge into a 3D anatomical understanding, approached with utmost respect for the silent teachers.</p>
<p>I will fully utilize National Cheng Kung University’s academic resources—laboratories, libraries, and Collaborative Notes—to prepare for clinical learning. Facing the first stage of the national physician licensing exam at the end of Year 4, I will adopt a systematic study strategy: organizing knowledge around major body systems (cardiovascular, respiratory, and digestive) and integrating content from Anatomy, Physiology,</p>
<p>Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Pathology, and Microbiology. This will create a coherent knowledge framework rather than fragmented memorization. I will also practice past exams and analyze my mistakes to strengthen my readiness.</p>
<h3 id="years-5-6-clinical-immersion-and-practical-application">Years 5–6: Clinical Immersion and Practical Application</h3>
<p>Clinical rotations are a crucial point where knowledge turns into healing power. With humility and devotion, I shall start my clinical training at National Cheng Kung University Hospital by following attendings during ward rounds, attending morning meetings, and discussing cases to learn the logic behind clinical decision-making.
I will acquire all the clinical skills orientation from history-taking to medical record writing and the total patient care concept, embedding patients&#39; medical, psychological, and social issues in the patient&#39;s core. I aim to become a competent clerk and co-traveler with the patient in the journey towards health.</p>
<p>National Cheng Kung University has great international exchange opportunities for toppers with other universities, enabling me to engage in such short-term overseas exchanges during Year 5 or 6, exchanges with the University of Hong Kong or the National University of Singapore, which may further nurture my global health perspective.</p>
<p>The goal for this stage is to complete the second step within the national physician licensing exams and the Objective Structured Clinical Examination, which serve as the conduits through which one acquires one&#39;s physician license, then moves on to applying for a PGY for residency at National Cheng Kung University Hospital.</p>
