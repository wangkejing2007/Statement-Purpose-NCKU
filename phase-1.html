  <h1 id="phase-1-foundation-and-orientation-preparation-before-university">Phase 1: Foundation and Orientation--Preparation Before University</h1>
  <p>To become a student who aligns with the expectations of the School of Medicine at National Cheng Kung University, my high school years were not solely dedicated to academic achievement but were a foundational journey for the future. I saw that period as a time of “quiet cultivation,” laying deep roots for steadily ascending the summit of medicine. From “science and the humanities” to the frontiers of medical research, I prepared myself comprehensively across these three domains to embrace the challenges ahead.</p>
  <h3 id="building-a-scaffold-for-scientific-understanding">Building a scaffold for scientific understanding</h3>
  <p>I understand medicine is built on solid ground in the basic sciences. Hence, during high school, I put exceptional effort into Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Mathematics—not content with simply learning them in class but intent on understanding the principles underlying the knowledge. I feel that only a good understanding of a few basic scientific principles will enable one to integrate complex medical knowledge in the future.
  Before entering National Cheng Kung University, I plan to preview several key subjects. I will make a schedule to learn Calculus by myself, using online resources. And also cellular structures and how life works in the basics of Biology. I plan to learn Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and to become fluent in the language of amino acids, enzymes, and metabolic pathways.</p>
  <h3 id="cultivating-humanistic-qualities">Cultivating humanistic qualities</h3>
  <p>A good physician embodies a scientific mind and a humanistic heart. Hence, I have pursued community service seeking empathy, communication, teamwork, and problem-solving skills. A continual endeavor, a multidimensional approach of professional knowledge and humanistic literacy, suitable for the ideal of National Cheng Kung University's matching integrated medicine and the humanities. Consequently, I earnestly seek to project a composite image of professional knowledge and humanistic literacy.
  During the summer, I will continue to further my volunteering at the hospital, where I will be able to closely witness doctor-patient relations and internalize the tenets of holistic care.</p>
  <h3 id="exploring-the-frontiers-of-medicine">Exploring the frontiers of medicine</h3>
  <p>Acting on such motivation, I did not limit my learning to school. Since I knew that National Cheng Kung University highly regarded student-centered learning and enthusiasm for scientific inquiry, I engaged myself vigorously in independent research on smart medicine.</p>
  <p>I would therefore like to advance my knowledge of molecular medicine, specifically the link between protein structures and the mechanisms of diseases, before entering medical school. Given my prior research on Alzheimer's disease in relation to β-amyloid, I think that studying bioinformatics will allow me to gain critical thinking and scientific literacy skills by keeping up with academic journals. Thus, such an investigation will form a strong basis in clinical and laboratory work.</p>
